    <p><strong>Fees and Other Charges.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Fee.</strong> BlowOutGoOut may assess a  “Service Fee” to support the BlowOutGoOut platform and related services provided to you by BlowOutGoOut. The amount of the Service Fee may vary but shall be retained by BlowOutGoOut in its entirety.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancellation Fee.</strong> After requesting a service appointment you may cancel it through the app, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee will apply.

      <li><strong>Credit Card Authorization.</strong> Upon addition of a new payment method or each service request, BlowOutGoOut may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the service cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or check card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank.</li>
